The objective of this project is to build a Garbage Segregation and Monitoring System that will segregate input garbage waste into namely three types â€“ Metal, Dry and Wet waste and send the status of the dustbin ( how full the dustbin is ) to the Cloud and display the status there. If the amount of garbage in the dustbin exceeds 70%, a notification is sent to the users e-mail, alerting the user. The segregation will be done by a conveyor belt setup, where the input garbage will pass by 2 sensors ( Moisture sensor and Inductive metal proximity sensor. No sensor needed for Dry waste as it will fall of the conveyor belt at the end of the path ) and upon detection by a sensor, a servo motor will block the path of the moving garbage, thus making it fall into its respective dustbin. Then the status of this Smart Dustbin (containing an Ultrasonic Sensor) will be monitored online. For this, we have used the API ThingSpeak to obtain and display the information from the sensor and with the help of Webhooks ( a web service that allows various websites to connect with each other ) have used IFTTT to send an e-mail notification to the user.
